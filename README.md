# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation - Unsupervised Machine Learning
 Customer segmentation is the process of separating a company's customers into groups based on their shared characteristics. The purpose of customer segmentation is to determine how to relate to customers in each category in order to optimize each customer's value to the company.

• Customer segmentation has the ability to help marketers reach out to each customer in the most efficient way possible. A customer segmentation study uses the huge quantity of data available on customers (and future customers) to identify distinct groups of consumers with a high degree of accuracy based on demographic, behavioural, and other characteristics.

• Insights from customer segmentation are used to develop tailor-made marketing campaigns and for designing overall marketing strategy and planning.

• To conclude, we saw how we can segment our customer depending on our business requirements. You can perform RFM for your entire customer base, or just a subset. For example, you may first segment customers based on a geographical area or other demographics, and then by RFM for historical, transaction-based behaviour segments.

• RFM analysis can help in answering many questions with respect to their customers and this can help companies to make marketing strategies for their customers, retaining their slipping customers and providing recommendations to their customer based on their interest. We used the K-means algorithm to segment our customer in various clusters having similar similarity. I think K-means did a pretty good job here.
Problem Statement : In this project, the task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
Business problem overview : The goal of this job is to use cluster analysis to identify important consumer categories in a transnational data set that encompasses all transactions for a UK-based and registered non-store internet retailer over a specific time period.
